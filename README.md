BetterCallerID uses numverify API to validate incoming calls as real numbers or will warn you if they are invalid.
Upon receiving a call, you will get a notification of containing the following:

- General Location

- Carrier

- Line-type

BetterCallerID is essentially to fight spam calls and was directly influenced by my own experience with them.
